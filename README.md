discord bot that cares about your privacy

## why java?
i have an ap exam in 2 months on it, so i locked myself into the language. it's
also not the worst language to write a bot in.

## why spring boot?
it's sooo easy to use dbs with it.

## should i run it?
no there's 0 support but you probably can if you try hard enough.
